 JavaCanvas for Java SE 6+ 
===========================

This project is based on 
https://github.com/w3canvas/javacanvas

It implements the 'HTML 5 Canvas' standard for the Java SE runtime. By using Mozilla Rhino, it's possible to execute JavaScript code like from the animation library TweenJS (http://www.createjs.com/#!/TweenJS) within a standard Java Desktop or Applet application.
